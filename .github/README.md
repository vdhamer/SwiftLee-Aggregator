## About The Project
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/vdhamer/SwiftLeeAggregator)

This app aggregates blog posts written by SwiftLee (Antoine van der Lee). SwiftLee has a weekly blog on Swift and iOS software development. 

Note that this app is only **a SwiftLee aggregator and not an app developed by SwiftLee**. The author of the postings (SwiftLee) has no responsibility for the aggregator app. And the developer of the app (vdHamer) has no control over the postings. In case you are wondering, both parties did align ;-)

The aggregator uses a small database containing the metadata (title, date, URLs) of the postings on the SwiftLee site. It doesn't contain the postings themselves. When the app launches, the database is updated in background by fetching the SwiftLee website's RSS feed, passing the RSS through an online RSS-to-JSON convertor, decoding the JSON to memory, and merging the in-memory data with existing data in the database. The database (Core Data) improves app startup time, but also tracks which posts have already been opened by the user.

### Built With
* [Swift](https://www.swift.org)
* [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata)
* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
* [RSS to JSON convertor](https://rss2json.com/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Distribution
The app is only available via GitHub. It isn’t distributed via the Apple App Store to avoid confusion. And, frankly, the app doesn’t provide provide much functionality compared to the existing SwiftLee website: the app is partly used as a lightweight testbed to try out some programming techniques (like JSON decoding, Concurrency and Core Data).

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, use GitHub’s `Open with Xcode` feature, compile and run on a simulator or physical device. Those who prefer running git from the command line should be able to manage on their own.

### Installation
1. Get your personal API key at [rss2json.com](https://rss2json.com/docs). This involves signing up for an account with rss2json. The `rss2json` free plan should have more than enough quota to view the feed as often as you like. Please carefully save the API key code.
It allows you to generate a fair amount of traffic via `rss2json.com` without having to worry about traffic generated by others.
2. Clone the repository to your development environment: `Code`,  `Code`,  `Open with Xcode`, `Allow` GitHub to launch Xcode, select a location for the directory, and press `Clone`.
3. Enter your personal API key in the file `Utilities`/`ApiKey.swift`
Don’t forget to uncomment the `let apiKey` line of code. By default it reads:
```
// insert your rss2json.com API key and uncomment
// let apiKey = "thisisthespotwhereyouinsertyourownapikey" 
```
The line is commented out because I have a second file containing my own `let apiKey` line. That second file is not on GitHub.
4. You can now compile the project to install it on an actual device (you may need to deploy it again after half a year) or run the code on a device simulator in the usual way.

## Usage
When you launch the app, and it will list all currently available posts on SwiftLee's site.

The Search field allows you to filter the available posts. It searches the title fields only; it does not search the actual post text or keywords.

If you click on an post's entry on the list, it will load the actual post in a browser tab.

The app keeps track on which posts you have opened using a database (Core Data). At the moment, you can't "unread" a post. But you can clear the on-device database by removing and reinstalling the app.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Roadmap
- [x] Complete the readme
- [x] Automatically fetch older posts via extra fetch requests (at 10 posts per request)
	- [x] Add a search bar to filter the list (needed if there are hundreds of posts)
- [x] Minor bug fixing and cleanup
- [x] Store the posts on-device
- [x] Keep track of which posts have been clicked on, and visualize this using the `mail` icon to the left of the title
    - [ ] Unread functionality: it is easy to open a post, but takes time to seriously read it.
    - [ ] Button to reset the database without uninstall/install
- [ ] Ability to mark a posting with a Star (locally). For whatever reason.
- [ ] Clean up the loose ends of Core Data (various warnings in the log)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/vdhamer/SwiftLeeAggregator/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing
Any contributions are appreciated. If you have a suggestion that would make this better, you can fork the repo and create a pull request.  The command line `git` commands to do this (but the Xcode IDE has equivalent commands under `Source Control`):

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

You can alternatively submit an `issue` with a tag like ”enhancement" or “bug” without having to do the code changes yourself. 
Don't forget to give the project a star in GitHub!
